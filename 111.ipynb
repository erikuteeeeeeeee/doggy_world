        "Raymond is Python's core contributor and one of the most amazing teachers of programming in the world.\n",
        "His extraordinary ability to explain how to elegantly solve practical and not trivial business problems using Python.\n",
        "What is even more fascinating is that he manages to do that using \"little code\", which is easy to read, understand, and maintain.\n",
        "Another exceptional resource is the Data Science from Scratch book by Joel Grus.\n",
        "This book is unique, because instead of teaching you how to use the most popular libraries and tools, it shows you how to implement the most useful algorithms from scratch.\n",
        "This approach is so valuable that this book will be your companion not only in this Sprint or Module, but throughout the whole Course.\n",
        "In addition you will do a lot of exercises in Codesignal and Python Workout.\n",
        "These exercises are essential for you to understand how to apply your understanding of programming in practice.\n",
        "This will also allow you to practice writing code succinctly and elegantly.\n",
        "Finally, you will learn some very practical skill that every data scientist should have: writing clean code, using Docker, building your own package, etc.\n"

The fact that nearly every type of data knows how to work inside of a `for` loop makes such loops common and useful. If you're working with database records, elements in an XML file, or the results from searching for text using regular expressions, you'll be using `for` loops quite a bit.\n",

Python 2’s input function was considered dangerous, since it would ask the user for input and then evaluate the resulting string using the `eval` function. (If you’re interested, see http://mng.bz/6QGG.) In Python 3, the dangerous function has gone away, and the safe one has been renamed `input`."
